## Introduction to 6502 Assembly

### Video

- [Summary video recording from class](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/bcb8d448-84bc-4c36-909f-58bc1ccd1dfe)
- [Calculating 6502 Program Execution Time](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/ed7aedf1-fe6f-4b72-bbf1-c9b4e6e80af9)
- **Reminder**: The Wednesday classes are live. An edited recording is provided for reference only - it is no substitute for attending class (via Zoom), taking notes, and asking questions!

### Machine Language, Assembly Language

**Follow the Links!:** To get the full benefit of the following material, please follow the links embedded within it. For additional detail, see the Category links at the bottom of those pages -- for example, the category linked from many of the following pages has over 30 pages of content.

- Although we program computers in a variety of languages, they can really only execute one language: [Machine Language](/E-ComputerArchitecture/machine-language.md), which is encoded in an architecture-specific binary code, sometimes called object code.
- Machine language is not easy to read. [Assembly Language](/F-AssemblyLanguage/assembly-language.md) corresponds very closely to machine language, but is (sort of!) human-readable.
- Assembly language is converted into machine code by a particular type of compiler called an [Assembler](/E-ComputerArchitecture/assembler.md) (sometimes the language itself is also referred to as "Assembler").

### 6502

Modern processors are complex - the reference manual for 64-bit ARM processors is over 11000 pages long! - so we're going to look at assembly language on a much simpler processor to get started. This processor is the 6502, a processor used in many early home and personal computers as well as video game systems, including the Commodore PET, VIC-20, C64; the Apple II; the Atari 400 and 800 computers and 2600 video game systems; and many others.
