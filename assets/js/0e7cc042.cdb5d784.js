Because some users work with command-line clients, it can be difficult to copy-and-paste these URLs into the browser. A better solution is to use a URL shortener such as ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://tinyurl.com/"},"TinyURL.com")," or ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://bit.ly/"},"bit.ly"),", which allows users to paste and submit long URLs in order to generate a much shorter URL.
