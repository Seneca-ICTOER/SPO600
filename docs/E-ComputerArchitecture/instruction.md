# Instruction

An _Instruction_ is the smallest unit of code in [Machine Language](./machine-language.md). Each instruction consists of an [operation](./operation.md), [addressing mode](./addressing-mode.md) information, and zero or more arguments such as register numbers, addresses, bit counts, or [immediate values](./immediate-value.md). Each instruction is [encoded](./instruction-encoding.md) into a binary value in the program text.
