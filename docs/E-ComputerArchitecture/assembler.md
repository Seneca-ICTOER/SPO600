# Assembler

An _assembler_ is a [compiler](./compiler.md) for [assembly language](/F-AssemblyLanguage/assembly-language.md) code. (Assembly language code itself is sometimes called "assembler").

On Linux systems, the GNU Assembler ("gas") is a very commonly-used assembler.

In the [6502 Emulator](/G-6502/6502-emulator.md), the "Assemble" button invokes an assembler.
