# Disassembler

A _disassembler_ is a tool which converts [machine code](./machine-language.md) to an assembly language representations.

On GNU Linux systems, the _objdump_ tool acts as a disassembler. The GNU debugger (gdb) can also do disassembly.

In the [6502 Emulator](/G-6502/6502-emulator.md), the "Disassemble" button invokes a disassembler.
