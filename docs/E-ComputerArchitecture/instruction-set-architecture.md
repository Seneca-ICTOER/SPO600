# Instruction Set Architecture

The Instruction Set Architecture of a processor is the set of [instructions](./instruction.md) which that processor can execute, the [addressing modes](./addressing-mode.md) available, and the [encoding](./instruction-encoding.md) of those instructions as [machine code](./machine-language.md).
