# Portable

A _portable_ program is one which may be used on multiple architectures or operating systems.

Related terms:

- Port - to modify a program to work on a particular [architecture](./computer-architecture.md).
- Portable - a program which can be used on multiple [architectures](./computer-architecture.md), typically by compiling/building for a specific target architecture. Note that **portable** does not necessarily mean **able to be ported** -- it is often used to mean code which does not need to be ported, because it is architecture-neutral (i.e., contains no assembler, [word](./word.md) size assumptions, or other architecture-specific code, and can be compiled (or interpreted) from a high-level language on a wide range of architecture types).
- Architecture-specific - code which is usable only on one or more specific [architectures](./computer-architecture.md) (this is the opposite of **portable**).
- Non-portable - synonym for architecture-specific (often extremely so!)
- Cross-platform - Code which will execute either on multiple [architectures](./computer-architecture.md) or on multiple operating systems.
