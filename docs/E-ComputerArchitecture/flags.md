# Flags

**Flags** are single-bit values which may be either on / set / binary "1" or off / cleared / binary 0.

Most CPUs have a [status register](./register.md#status-register) containing multiple flag bits indicating current status; they may also have [control registers](./register.md#control-registers) which alter the operation of the CPU. Flags may also be maintained by software, or appear in IO device registers.
